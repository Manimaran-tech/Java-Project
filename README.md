# Smart Waste Bin Monitoring System 🗑️

### 🧩 Project Type
College OOP Mini Project — part of my journey of learning **Java** and exploring **Object-Oriented Programming concepts**.

---

## 📘 Project Description
The **Smart Waste Bin Monitoring System** is a Java-based GUI application that simulates a smart waste management system.  
It uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism** to monitor and display the fill level of a waste bin in real time.

When the bin level exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 80%), the system automatically displays an alert to notify that the bin needs to be emptied.  
This project is a simple representation of how **IoT-inspired ideas** can be implemented using **Java and Swing GUI**.

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time bin level simulation  
- Visual progress bar (GUI)  
- Alert messages for full bin status  
- Reset functionality to empty the bin  
- Simple and clean Java Swing interface  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects  
- Inheritance and Interfaces  
- Event Handling  
- GUI Programming using Java Swing  

---

## 🧰 Requirements
- Java JDK 8 or above  
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or BlueJ)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the project files.  
2. Open your IDE and create a new Java project.  
3. Add a new file named `SmartWasteBin.java`.  
4. Copy the provided source code into it.  
5. Run the program — a GUI window will appear to simulate the smart bin.
